# Crypto-Tracker

Multipurpose Crypto project that uses the Binance API to pull live price open, high, close data. Uses TV LightWeight charts for displaying real time crypto price, as well as backtesting scripts for testing strategies. This project follows a tutorial on Youtube for getting TV charts to work. Other backtesting scripts use the Backtrader library.

This is apersonal project to learn, there is no formal direction for this application other than for learning purposes. 

# To install

Install all libraries from the rquirements.txt into an enviroment, must use conda-forge to insall Backtrader. Or at least the whats I had to do to get it to work... 

Dont forget to add your Binance api keys to the config.py file.

Have Fun!
